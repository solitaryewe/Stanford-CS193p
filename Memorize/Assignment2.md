## Task 1
> Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 through 4.  Type in all the code.  Do not copy/paste from anywhere.

‚úîÔ∏è

## Task 2
> Your game should still shuffle the cards.

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
private static func createMemoryGame(theme: EmojiMemoryGameTheme) -> MemoryGame<String> {
    let emojis = theme.emojiSet.shuffled()
    let numberOfPairsOfCards = theme.numberOfPairs != nil ? theme.numberOfPairs! : Int.random(in: 2...theme.emojiSet.count)
    return MemoryGame<String>(numberOfPairsOfCards: numberOfPairsOfCards) { pairIndex in emojis[pairIndex] }
}
```

## Task 3
> Architect the concept of  a ‚Äútheme‚Äù into your game.  A theme consists of  a name for the theme, a set of  emoji to use, a number of  cards to show (which, for at least one, but not all themes, should be random), and an appropriate color to use to draw (e.g. orange would be appropriate for a Halloween theme).

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
struct EmojiMemoryGameTheme {
    var name: String
    var emojiSet: [String]
    var color: Color
    var numberOfPairs: Int?
}
```

## Task 4
> Support at least 6 different themes in your game.

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
private let emojiMemoryGameThemes: [EmojiMemoryGameTheme] = [
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Halloween", emojiSet: ["üëª","üéÉ","üï∑","ü¶á","üç≠","üç¨","üç´","üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è","üï∏","üëÄ","üíÄ","üßπ"], color: Color.orange),
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Birds", emojiSet: ["ü¶ú","ü¶©","ü¶É","ü¶Ü","ü¶¢","ü¶ö","üêì"], color: Color.blue, numberOfPairs: 4),
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Fairytale", emojiSet: ["ü¶Ñ","üå∑","ü¶ï","üè∞","üëë","‚ú®","üê∏"], color: Color.purple),
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Farm Animals", emojiSet: ["üêÑ","üêñ","üêê","üêì","üêá","üêë","ü¶É"], color: Color.green),
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Space", emojiSet: ["üëΩ","üöÄ","üõ∞","üõ∏","üåé","‚≠êÔ∏è","üåû"], color: Color.gray, numberOfPairs: 5),
    EmojiMemoryGameTheme(name: "Fruit", emojiSet: ["üçä","üçâ","üçí","üçì","üçê","ü•ù","üçå","üçá"], color: Color.red, numberOfPairs: 3)
]
```

## Task 5
> A new theme should be able to be added to your game with a single line of code.

See above.

## Task 6
> Add a ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù button to your UI which begins a brand new game.  This new game should have a randomly chosen theme.  You can put this button anywhere you think looks best in your UI.

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGameView.swift
Button(action: { viewModel.newGame() }) {
    Text("New Game").font(.title3).bold()
}
```

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
public func newGame() {
    gameTheme = emojiMemoryGameThemes.randomElement()!
    model = EmojiMemoryGame.createMemoryGame(theme: gameTheme)
}
```

## Task 7
> Show the theme‚Äôs name somewhere in your UI.

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
Text(viewModel.gameTheme.name).font(.largeTitle)
```

## Task 8
> Keep score in your game by giving 2 points for every match and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch.

Add cards we've seen to the alreadySeenCards array:
```swift
// MemoryGame.swift
private var alreadySeenCards: [Int] = [Int]()
var indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard: Int? {
    get { cards.indices.filter { index in cards[index].isFaceUp }.only }
    set {
        for index in cards.indices {
            if index != newValue && cards[index].isFaceUp && !cards[index].isMatched {
                if !alreadySeenCards.contains(index) { alreadySeenCards.append(index) }
            }
            cards[index].isFaceUp = index == newValue
        }
    }
}
```

When attempting to make a match, check if we've seen the cards in the attempted match before and adjust score accordingly:
```swift
// MemoryGame.swift
mutating func choose(_ card: Card) {
    if let chosenIndex: Int = cards.firstIndex(matching: card), !cards[chosenIndex].isFaceUp, !cards[chosenIndex].isMatched {
        if let potentialMatchIndex = indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard {
            if cards[chosenIndex].content == cards[potentialMatchIndex].content {
                // Got a match.
                cards[chosenIndex].isMatched = true
                cards[potentialMatchIndex].isMatched = true
                score += 2
            } else {
                // Mismatch.
                if alreadySeenCards.contains(potentialMatchIndex) { score -= 1 }
                if alreadySeenCards.contains(chosenIndex) { score -= 1 }
            }
            cards[chosenIndex].isFaceUp = true
        } else {
            indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard = chosenIndex
        }
    }
}
```

## Task 9
> Display the score in your UI in whatever way you think looks best.

```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
Text("Score: \(viewModel.score)").font(.title3)
```

## Task 10
> Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iOS device.  The cards can have any aspect ratio you‚Äôd like.  This probably will not require any work on your part (that‚Äôs part of  the power of  SwiftUI), but be sure to continue to experiment with running on different simulators in Xcode to be sure.

## Extra Credit 1
> Support a gradient as the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù for a theme.  Hint: fill() can take a gradient as its argument rather than a color.

Themes are now created with a primaryColor and optional secondaryColor, allowing us to generate a gradient for the theme.  Themes created with only a primaryColor will have a gradient that appears solid:
```swift
// EmojiMemoryGame.swift
struct EmojiMemoryGameTheme {
    var name: String
    var emojiSet: [String]
    private(set) var primaryColor: Color
    private(set) var secondaryColor: Color?
    var numberOfPairs: Int?

    var gradient: Gradient {
        Gradient(colors: [primaryColor, secondaryColor != nil ? secondaryColor! : primaryColor])
    }
    var accentColor: Color {
        primaryColor
    }
}
```

I changed CardView struct to accept a gradient and accent color to use when drawing the cards:
```swift
// EmojiMemoryGameView.swift
struct CardView: View {
    var card: MemoryGame<String>.Card
    var gradient: Gradient
    var accentColor: Color

...

    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius).fill(LinearGradient(gradient: gradient, startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom))
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius).stroke(lineWidth: edgeLineWidth)

...
```

## Extra Credit 2
> Modify the scoring system to give more points for choosing cards more quickly.  For example, maybe you get max(10 - (number of  seconds since last card was chosen), 1) x (the number of  points you would have otherwise earned or been penalized with).  (This is just an example, be creative!). You will definitely want to familiarize yourself  with the Date struct.

When setting indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard, update timer to get the date when there is one card face up, because we want the time measured to start when we flip the first card (of a possible match) over.
```swift
// MemoryGame.swift
private var timer: Date = Date()

var indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard: Int? {
    get { cards.indices.filter { index in cards[index].isFaceUp }.only }
    set {
        ...
        timer = Date()
    }
}
```

When we have a match, more points are awarded for a faster match.
Date().timeIntervalSince(timer) gives us the number of seconds since we flipped the first card in the pair over:
```swift
// MemoryGame.swift
mutating func choose(_ card: Card) {
    if let chosenIndex: Int = cards.firstIndex(matching: card), !cards[chosenIndex].isFaceUp, !cards[chosenIndex].isMatched {
        if let potentialMatchIndex = indexOfTheOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard {
            // 1 face up card.
            if cards[chosenIndex].content == cards[potentialMatchIndex].content {
                // Got a match.
                let secondsForMatch = Date().timeIntervalSince(timer)
                score += max(10-Int(secondsForMatch), 2)
   ...
```
